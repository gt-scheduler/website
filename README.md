## üîç Overview

The app is a React single-page application (SPA) (built using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) that forms the frontend website users interact with when they go to https://gt-scheduler.org/. It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (a typed superset of JavaScript), and uses [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling (a superset of CSS that supports advanced features).

To implement its goal of facilitating schedule creation and class exploration, GT Scheduler stores all data **locally in cookies**. Then, it sources any relevant data at runtime from a variety of sources, such as:

- The list of terms (strings like `202008`, which corresponds to Fall 2020) that have been scraped by the [Crawler application](https://api.github.com/repos/gt-scheduler/crawler/): https://gt-scheduler.github.io/crawler/index.json
- The data for a single term, which is the full output of the Cralwer application in a single JSON file: https://gt-scheduler.github.io/crawler/202008.json
- Seating information for a single section, which is requested on demand and sent through our CORS proxy in the [Backend application](https://api.github.com/repos/gt-scheduler/crawler/) to [Oscar](https://oscar.gatech.edu/) (Georgia Tech's registration management system): https://gt-scheduler.azurewebsites.net/proxy/class_section?term=202008&crn=87086
- Course/instructor GPA information, which is fetched from [Course Critique](https://critique.gatech.edu/)'s API: https://c4citk6s9k.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test/data/course?courseID=CS%201331

Once features are merged into the `main` branch, they are automatically deployed to the `gh-pages` branch using a [GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/gt-scheduler/website/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml). This branch is set up to serve traffic to the public site, https://gt-scheduler.org/, using the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service.

The website uses [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) for aggregate analytics and information about how many people are using the app. It also utilizes [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for automatic error reporting.

## üöÄ Running Locally

### Requisite software

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (any recent version will probably work)
- Installation of the [`yarn` package manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) **version 1** (support for version 2 is untested)

### Running the app

After cloning the repository to your local computer, run the following command in the repo folder:

```
yarn install
```

This may take a couple minutes and will create a new folder called `node_modules` with all of the dependencies installed within. This only needs to be run once.

Then, to start a local development version of the frontend app, run:

```
yarn start
```

The app should then be viewable at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), which you can open a new browser tab to view.

With that, you're able to make changes to the code and have them be re-built and viewable after a short delay in the same tab. This is the main workflow for adding new features or fixing bugs and testing them in the actual app.

### Linting

The project uses pre-commit hooks using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) and [`lint-staged`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) to run linting (via [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)) and formatting (via [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)). These can be run manually from the command line to format/lint the code on-demand, using the following commands:

- `yarn run lint` - runs ESLint and reports all linting errors without fixing them
- `yarn run lint:fix` - runs ESLint and reports all linting errors, attempting to fix any auto-fixable ones
- `yarn run format` - runs Prettier and automatically formats the entire codebase
- `yarn run format:check` - runs Prettier and reports formatting errors without fixing them

## üë©‚Äçüíª Contributing

The GT Scheduler project welcomes (and encourages) contributions from the community. Regular development is performed by the project owners (Jason Park and [Bits of Good](https://bitsofgood.org/)), but we still encourage others to work on adding new features or fixing existing bugs and make the registration process better for the Georgia Tech community.

More information on how to contribute can be found [in the contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
